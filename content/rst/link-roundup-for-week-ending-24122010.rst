It's been a while since we posted a link roundup. With holidays starting soon, we thought of advancing the post.


* Are you a `full-stack programmer`_? Interesting article by Carlos Bueno of Facebook on the various interconnections in computing.
* `Daniel Greenfeld`_ wrote a post on why he prefers `stupid template languages`. His post received reactions from `Armin Ronacher`_, author of Jinja2, `Mike Bayer`_ of Mako and `Steve Holden`_, chairman of the PSF.
* If you are using Django 1.1, then it is time for you to upgrade to the latest minor revision in the series 1.1.3. Check the `security release`_ post.
* Django 1.3 beta 1 has been released and we can expect some good news soon. Check `James Bennett's`_ post on the djangoproject site.
* `markitup`_ is a jQuery plugin that converts a textarea into a markup editor. It supports a wide variety of markup languages and has a neat preview feature. All this under 10Kb.
* `Yann Malet`_ of LincolnLoop has a post on using proxy models in django to customize the admin.
* Disqus has released quite a few interesting projects off late and Nexus_ seems to be very interesting.
* Skype was down for quite some time today and almost totally cut us off. `Dan York`_ has an article on understanding the Skype outage.
* `Red Hat`_ has touched an annual revenue of $1 billion. It has the distinction of the first open source company to touch this figure. Now if only, they could upgrade the python version on their enterprise linux variants ;-)
