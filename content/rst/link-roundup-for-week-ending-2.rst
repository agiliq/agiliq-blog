* How DOM events work? Fantastic article_ by `Jeremy Kahn`_ of JupiterJS_.
* django_ gets class based views. Thanks to everyone who contributed_. Check the
  doc_ for more details and the migration_ guide.
* Search Engine Foo: Use DuckDuckGo_ to search the django_ and python_ docs from
  within your browser. Just use `!django <search query>` or a `!python <search query>`
  to search the docs. Check a `django example search`_ and `python example search`_.
  DuckDuckGo_ has a lot of other goodies_ too.
* Wilson_ is a `node.js`_ web framework whose goal is to bring along the parts of
  django_ without tightly coupling them. Plate_ is a javascript template library
  compatible with the django_ templating language. Both projects are the brain
  child of `Chris Dickson`_.
* With the inclusion_ of django-staticfiles in contrib, there's been a `good debate`_
  on the decision behind adding apps to contrib. Jacob_ talks about how he wouldn't
  have a contrib if he was to rewrite django_ from scratch and the decision behind not
  including some popular apps like `Django Debug Toolbar`_, South_ and `django-registration`_
  into contrib. Do read and chime in your thoughts.
* Build cross-device javascript applications for smartphones with the
  `jQuery Mobile Framework`_.
* Starting from November 1, Amazon plans to offer a micro EC2 instance free for an year
  for new customers. Check the page_ for more details.
* The results_ of the `Git Survey 2010`_ are out. Not very different compared to the
  `last year's`_ results (from a quick glance).
* `Continuous integration with django and hudson`_ is a blog post by `Michael Foord`_.
  He also has a related_ post on his personal blog.
* Merchant_, the django_ app that provides a uniform API and pluggable interface
  for various payment processors now has 'some' docs_. Let us know how we can improve
  the project further.
