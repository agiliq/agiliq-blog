Summary: I wrote a [new tutorial](http://www.42topics.com/dumps/appengine-search/doc.html) on building a search engine using Appengine, and Yahoo Search API [here](http://www.42topics.com/dumps/appengine-search/doc.html). This uses pure Appengine API, and not Django, and is a tutorial on how to use Appengine without Django.
