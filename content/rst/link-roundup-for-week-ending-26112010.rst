* In `Washington Times'`_ article on app-centric django development, they discuss the pros and cons of breaking your project into multiple apps.
* `Luke Plant`_ writes how class based views in django views makes the code feel a bit like Ravioli (too many small classes with difficulty locating and identifying their functionality).
* While we are at Ravioli, here is an interesting presentation about `"How to stop writing Spaghetti code"`_ in node.js.
* `Eric Holscher`_ has a post on how to use Haystack search to index non-database content.
* Facebook_ has written a blog post on "The underlying technology of Messages". Most of the projects are open-sourced. Interesting!
* Bing_ has decided to contribute to the OpenStreeMap project. As a part of this initiative, they have hired Steve Coast (founder of OSM) and plan to open their Aerial imagery for use to OSM.
* For all those who were left disappointed with Google's decision to discontinue Google Wave, there are plans by the company to release_ it as an Apache project.
* `Tim Bray`_ has an introductory article on "What Android Is". Easy read for a newbie.
* "Invent your own computer games with python" in a `free eBook`_ that plans to teach the basic concepts of writing a game in Python. What makes this effort interesting? This book was written to be understandable by kids as young as 10 to 12 years old!
* In probably the biggest news of the week, Novell_ has sold itself to Attachmate for a reported sum of $2.2bn. Wonder who holds the copyrights for Unix now?
