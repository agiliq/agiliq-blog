* jQuery 1.4.4 and jQuery mobile alpha 2 were released_ this week. Progress on the jQuery mobile development seems to be very brisk at the moment.
* `Eric Holscher`_ wrote a series of posts on building a django app server with Chef.
* Do you generally have a tough time deciphering captchas? TextCaptcha_ is a service that uses text based questions to separate the humans from machines. It's got an API too!
* Django Dose community catchup Episode #30 is out. Check it out today_.
* All references to the project name from the imports in the django tutorial have been removed in `changeset 14066`_. Hopefully, this will clear the air for quite a few newbies!
* `Django 1.3 alpha 1`_ is out. Get involved (through sprints_ being organized this month and the next) for the upcoming release.
* Phono_ is a jQuery plugin that turns any web browser into a phone; capable of making phone calls and and sending instant messages.  
* `Jacob Kaplan-Moss`_ has been experimenting with Buildbot and has come up with a series of posts explaining his requirements and documenting it.
* BFG, a python web framework has merged with the Pylons project and will be known as Pyramid_ henceforth. A very interesting development!
* RevSys conducted an `office-hours`_ on November 5th with Jacob and Frank taking questions on IRC from 50 odd participants. `django-socialauth`_ figured in the discussion and there were complaints about the lack of documentation. We are listening and plan to improve it!
